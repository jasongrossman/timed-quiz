Brief Description:

* Timed quiz containing 5 questions relating to JavaScript
* User inputs their name at the beginning and answers questions, losing 5pts(seconds) for every incorrect answer.
* Upon completing the quiz, their high score is saved to local storage.
* User can replay the game once completed, and review high scores and clear high score history.
* With thanks to TA Amit for helping me randomize my question choice options by teaching me how to use lodash third party API.
